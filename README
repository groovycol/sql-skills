Bonnie,
This assignment did not go as planned. I'm having trouble with psql on my Windows machine. It was working earlier this week, so I'm unsure of what changed. I suspect perhaps I quit out of psql unceremoniously, but have failed to resolve the issue.

Here's the issue:
*******************************************************************************
~/homework/skills_assessment/week4-sql $ psql
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
~/homework/skills_assessment/week4-sql $
*******************************************************************************

BUT, this works:
*******************************************************************************
~/homework/skills_assessment/week4-sql $ psql -p 5432 -h localhost
Password:
psql (9.5.1, server 9.4.6)
Type "help" for help.

groovycol=#
*******************************************************************************

I can see that the postgres service is running on windows, I was able to run createdb (but only with those same flags), and populate the database, but now I can't access those tables.

setting an alias of psql='psql -p 5432 -h localhost' helped a bit with the command line, but psycopg2 wasn't inclined to play along.

*******************************************************************************
(env) ~/homework/skills_assessment/week4-sql $ python quiz.py
Traceback (most recent call last):

*******************************************************************************

I tried to reverse engineer the quiz files to see if I could pull out the questions, but it's not a straight-forward task, so I did the more-practice.sql and called it a day.
